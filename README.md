# Next.js e-Commerce Store 🛍️

This is my personal project, Next.js e-Commerce Store, built using Next.js and bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. The store showcases a clean, reactive, and customizable mobile-first UI.

## Highlights ✨

- 🎨 **UI Components**: Crafted with React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions.

- 🌐 **State Management**: Leveraged Zustand for a seamless and responsive user experience.

- 💳 **Stripe Payments**: Comprehensive Stripe integration allows for in-app payments. Real-time order status updates enabled through Stripe Webhooks.

- 🔄 **Dynamic Content**: Product pages and their content are dynamically generated, utilizing Stripe CMS and NextJS Dynamic Routes.

- 🔒 **Authentication**: Implemented conditional authentication redirects using NextAuth. Stripe payment intent and customer ID are proactively assigned in the database.
